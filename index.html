            It's important to always use '===' as your comparison operator. Doing this will save you alot of pain as it compares both value and type.

            <br> console.log(null==u ndefined)
            <br> returns -> true
            <br>
            <br> console.log(null === undefined)
            <br> returns -> false

            It is possible to give almost every variable in the environment a new value. This can be useful but also dangerous. If you give alert the value 8, it is no longer a function, and you wonâ€™t be able to use it to show messages. Reassigning the "Alert" function. Any JS function it seems can be re-assigned. Including Window.

            We all use functions in Objects, but they can also be used in Arrays.
            <br>
            <br> The important thing to remember is that functions are first class objects in JavaScript. So you can pass them around as parameters, use them as object values and so on. Value(s) in an array are just one example of that.
            <br>
            <br>Never used this pattern myself but it could lead to some interesting things. If Arrays and Objects are different then how does this effect the way they call 'child' functions?
            <script>
            getJS(useFunctionFromArray);

            Functions can be added, subtracted, multiplied, etc. The can also be compared, just about any logical operator works on them. in other words:
            <br>
            <br> one() + two() = 3

            When functions aren't invoked with "()"" they are returned as strings.
